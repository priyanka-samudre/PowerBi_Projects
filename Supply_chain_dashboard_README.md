# Supply Chain Dashboard Overview
## Introduction
This dashboard visualizes key metrics of a supply chain network, designed to offer insights into revenue generation, transportation efficiency, and cost analysis. Built using Power BI, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of how various elements within the supply chain interact and influence overall performance.

## Project Overview
The dashboard is structured to display critical KPIs such as total revenue, total cost, total products sold, and shipping costs by carrier. It also highlights the revenue and cost distribution across different transportation modes (Road, Rail, Air, and Sea) and evaluates these aspects based on various routes. Additionally, the revenue generated by product and the demographics (gender) involved in purchases are visualized for deeper analysis.

## Key Metrics and Visuals
Revenue by Product: Displays revenue figures for each supplier, allowing identification of top-performing suppliers based on sales figures.

Revenue by Transportation Mode: Illustrates how each transportation method contributes to overall revenue, with the highest being Road transport.

Cost by Transportation Mode: Shows the cost incurred by each transport method, helping to identify the most cost-efficient options.

Revenue by Gender: Compares revenue generated by male and female customers, providing demographic insights.

Shipping Costs by Carrier: Details shipping costs for different carriers (Carrier A, B, and C) to understand cost efficiency among providers.

Cost by Route: Analyzes the costs associated with different supply chain routes, providing insights into the most efficient routes.

## Learnings from Building the Dashboard
Data Integration and Transformation: Gained experience in integrating and cleaning supply chain data using Power BIâ€™s ETL capabilities, ensuring accurate and reliable insights.

Visual Design and Interpretation: Enhanced skills in designing dashboards that are both visually appealing and easy to interpret, focusing on actionable insights for supply chain decision-makers.
